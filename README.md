Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game for two players typically played using the players' hands. The two players each make a fist 
with one hand and hold the other open, palm upward. Together, they tap their fists in their open palms once, twice, and on 
the third time form one of three items: a rock (by keeping the hand in a fist), a sheet of paper (by holding the hand flat, 
palm down), or a pair of scissors (by extending the first two fingers and holding them apart).

The winner of that round depends on the items formed. If the same item is formed, it's a tie. If a rock and scissors are formed, 
the rock wins, because a rock can smash scissors. If scissors and paper are formed, the scissors win, because scissors can cut 
paper. If paper and a rock are formed, the paper wins, because a sheet of paper can cover a rock. After one round is completed,
another is begun. Play continues until one player reaches a predetermined score, or whenever the players' boredom is alleviated.
(Often this game is played to pass the time while waiting in line for something, or while on a long road trip.)

In my version of rock paper and scissors the game is played in browser's console window. This game is played by only one player
as for other member, it is played by computer. The game ends when one of the two players reaches a predetermined number of points. 
In this game it is set to five round who ever get highest point within the rounds win the game. Apart from these info all other 
rules are same which is used while playing a real rock paper and scissor game.
